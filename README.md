<sup><sub>F LumiNUS! IVLE ftw! Why fix what ain't broken?!</sub></sup>

Since IVLE will be deprecated next academic year (AY2019/2020), while LumiNUS has consistently pushed back its schedule to release an API, I have decided to reverse-engineer the API used by the Angular front-end of LumiNUS. Currently, my goal is to be able to automatically download files a la [ivle-sync](https://github.com/goweiwen/ivle-sync)

I try to keep to best coding practices and use as little dependencies as possible. Do let me know if you have any suggestions!

PR's are welcome.
